# Contributing Guide

Thanks for contributing to `cregit`!

## Before you open a pull request

For _large changes_, please _open an issue first_ to discuss the proposal.

This is especially important for:

- architectural changes
- cross-module refactors
- new dependencies
- changes to output formats, CLI behavior, or generated artifacts

## Commit messages

Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) for all commits.

Examples:

- `feat: add JSON export for blame artifacts`
- `fix(prettyPrint): escape HTML output correctly`
- `docs: rewrite root README in Markdown`

### Allowed types

- `feat`
- `fix`
- `docs`
- `refactor`
- `test`
- `build`
- `ci`
- `chore`
- `perf`

### Scope

A scope is _optional_, but encouraged when it helps.

Examples:

- `fix(remapCommits): handle empty commit messages`
- `feat(tokenize): add intermediate token dump option`

### Breaking changes

Mark breaking changes with `!` and explain them clearly in the pull request.

Example:

- `refactor!: change blame artifact format`

## Pull requests

Please follow the repository _pull request template_ when opening a PR.

### Titles

Pull request titles should follow the same [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org) format as commit messages.

Examples:

- `feat: add artifact manifest generation`
- `docs(persons): convert module README to Markdown`

### Scope

Keep pull requests _focused_.

- one logical change per pull request
- avoid mixing refactors, formatting, and behavior changes unless they are tightly related
- keep changes as small and reviewable as possible

## Testing

For code changes, include _validation steps_ in the pull request.

This can be:

- automated tests
- manual test steps
- example commands and outputs

_Documentation-only_ changes **do not** require testing.

## Documentation

If your change affects behavior, commands, configuration, outputs, or developer workflow, _update the relevant documentation_.

## Compatibility

If your change affects any of the following, call it out clearly in the pull request:

- CLI arguments
- environment variables
- intermediate artifacts
- database schema
- output formats
- generated HTML behavior
