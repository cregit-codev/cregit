# rustTokenizer

`rust_tokenizer` tokenizes Rust source into the line-oriented view used by Cregit, the
same format produced by the other tokenizers (`srcMLtoken`, `goTokenizer`) and consumed
by `blameRepo` and `prettyPrint`.

It uses [`ra-ap-rustc_lexer`](https://crates.io/crates/ra-ap-rustc_lexer), the lexer
`rustc` itself uses, so raw strings, byte literals, lifetimes vs. char literals, and
unicode identifiers are all handled correctly.

## Requirements

A Rust toolchain (`cargo`).

## How to use

`rust_tokenizer` reads a source file and writes the token stream to _stdout_:

```sh
rust_tokenizer <source.rs>
```

The flags `--language=Rust`, `--position`, and `--verbose` are accepted (and ignored)
so the `tokenize.pl` dispatcher can call it the same way as the other tokenizers.

## Output format

```
-:-	begin_unit|revision:...;language:Rust;cregit-version:...
LINE:COL	kind|value
...
-:-	end_unit
```

One token per line, prefixed with its `line:column` position (columns count code points,
not bytes). `kind` is one of `keyword`, `identifier`, `lifetime`, `literal`, `comment`,
`op`, or `unknown`. The `value` is emitted verbatim, with embedded newlines in literals
and block comments folded to spaces so each token stays on one line. Whitespace produces
no line.

## How to build

```sh
cargo build --release
```

This produces `target/release/rust_tokenizer`, the path `tokenize.pl` expects.

## How to test

```sh
cargo test
```
